# Pretrained EfficientDet Model for Character Head Detection

This repository contains pretrained EfficientDet model which detects character heads in illustrations. Models are trained using [zylo117's EfficientDet implementation](https://github.com/zylo117/Yet-Another-EfficientDet-Pytorch) and can be tested using the implementation.

## Model Performance

Models are trained on a dataset with manual annotations by myself.

\#Train Images = 3184

\#Val Images = 197
